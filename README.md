# RIMAPI
RIMAPI is a RimWorld mod that gives you an API Server to interact with your current game.

RIMAPI exposes a comprehensive REST API from inside RimWorld.
The API listens on `http://localhost:8765/` by default once the
game reaches the main menu. The port can be changed in the mod settings.

3. Use any HTTP client (curl, Postman, etc.) to call the endpoints.

**Request:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/api/v1/colonists
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "colonists": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "John",
      "age": 32,
      "health": 1.0
    }
